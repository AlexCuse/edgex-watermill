# edgex-watermill

This package primarily offers a watermill pub-sub binding for edgexfoundry application services using the SDK's Custom Trigger API.

It also offers messaging clients and Senders (similar to the builtin MQTTSecret sender) although these are less tested.

An example project is available under _example, or from the root project you can run `make run-example`
